**Design and implement computer vision applications with Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and Python 3**

## What is this book about?
Raspberry Pi is one of the popular single-board computers of our generation. All the major image processing and computer vision algorithms and operations can be implemented easily with OpenCV on Raspberry Pi. This updated second edition is packed with cutting-edge examples and new topics, and covers the latest versions of key technologies such as Python 3, Raspberry Pi, and OpenCV. This book will equip you with the skills required to successfully design and implement your own OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, and Python-based computer vision projects.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Set up a Raspberry Pi for computer vision applications
* Perform basic image processing with libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV
* Demonstrate arithmetic, logical, and other operations on images
* Work with a USB webcam and the Raspberry Pi Camera Module
* Implement low-pass filters and high-pass filters and understand their applications in image processing

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
p2 = Person()
p2.name = 'Jan
p2.age = 20
print(p2.name)
int(p2.age)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Python 3 developers, computer vision professionals, and Raspberry Pi
enthusiasts who are looking to implement computer vision applications on a low-cost
platform. Basic knowledge of programming, mathematics, and electronics will be
beneficial. However, even beginners in this area will be comfortable with covering
the contents of the book as they are presented in a step-by-step manner

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
